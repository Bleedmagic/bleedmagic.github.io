# Victor Vasquez

Welcome to my personal GitHub Page. I'm currently exploring software development, building projects, and learning new technologies. This site will serve as a central hub for my work and updates.

## About Me

I'm a developer in the early stages of my journey, with a focus on learning the foundations of modern software development. I'm currently exploring:

- Git & GitHub workflows
- Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Python and scripting
- Open-source contributions

I'm passionate about clean code, learning in public, and building useful tools.

## Projects

I'm just getting started, but here are some areas I’m exploring:

- **Personal website** — This site, built with GitHub Pages and Jekyll.
- **Mini tools** — Small utilities written in Python or JavaScript.
- **Learning logs** — Notes and documentation from what I’m studying.

Future projects will appear here as I grow.
